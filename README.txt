Open PowerShell by right clicking it and running it as administrator, then once open type in: 
set-executionpolicy unrestricted 
Press enter and then hit A (or click on yes to all)

Run the script, let it do its thing, then when finished type in:

Set-executionpolicy restricted 

And you're done

Mind you, after an update MS might force the programs back onto your machine, re run the script if the apps are present again!
